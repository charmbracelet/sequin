# sequin

Parse ANSI sequences into human-readable format.

```console
$ printf '\033[48;2;255;0;0m\033[m' | sequin
CSI "\x1b[48;2;255;0;0m": Background color: {255 0 0 255}
CSI "\x1b[m": Reset style
```

## Use cases

The most basic use case is to describe what an escape sequence does when you
don't know it.

You can `printf '\x1betc' | sequin` and get an explanation!

More complex use cases might include checking [teatest's][] golden files, e.g.:

```console
$ cat ./testdata/TestApp.golden | sequin
CSI "\x1b[?25l": Disable private mode "cursor visibility"
CSI "\x1b[?2004h": Enable private mode "bracketed paste"
Control code "\r": carriage return
Text: "Hi. This program will exit in 10 seconds. To quit sooner press any key"
Control code "\n": line feed
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[A": Cursor up 1
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[2K": Erase entire line
Text: "Hi. This program will exit in 9 seconds. To quit sooner press any key."
Control code "\n": line feed
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[2K": Erase entire line
Control code "\r": carriage return
CSI "\x1b[?2004l": Disable private mode "bracketed paste"
CSI "\x1b[?25h": Enable private mode "cursor visibility"
CSI "\x1b[?1002l": Disable private mode "mouse cell motion"
CSI "\x1b[?1003l": Disable private mode "mouse all motion"
CSI "\x1b[?1006l": Disable private mode "mouse SGR ext"
```

So you may also use it to debug applications, and of course, to learn more!

## How it works

It relies heavily on our [ansi][] package, and whilst traversing the strings,
pretty prints what the sequences are doing.

## Current state

Common sequences are implemented, but there is still plenty of work to do!
If you notice one of such missing sequences, feel free to open a PR. üòÑ
