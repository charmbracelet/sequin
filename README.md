Sequin is a small utility that can help you debug your CLIs and TUIs. It's also
great for describing escape sequences you might not understand, and exploring
what TUIs are doing under the hood.

There are lots more use cases too, like inspecting golden files such as the
ones used by [`teatest`][teatest] to crystalize [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] output.

Are you using Sequin in an interesting way? We‚Äôd love to hear about it.

## Installation

Use a package manager:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
brew install charmbracelet/tap/sequin

# Arch Linux (btw)
yay -S sequin-bin

# Nix
nix-shell -p nur.repos.charmbracelet.sequin
```

<details>
<summary>Debian/Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install sequin
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora/RHEL</summary>

```bash
echo '[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install sequin
```

</details>

Or, download it:

- [Packages][releases] are available in Debian and RPM formats
- [Binaries][releases] are available for Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD

[releases]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods/releases

Or, just install it with `go`:

```sh
go install github.com/charmbracelet/sequin@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Shell Completions</summary>

All the packages and archives come with pre-generated completion files for Bash,
ZSH, Fish, and PowerShell.

If you built it from source, you can generate them with:

```bash
sequin completion bash -h
sequin completion zsh -h
sequin completion fish -h
sequin completion powershell -h
```

If you use a package (like Homebrew, Debs, etc), the completions should be set
up automatically, given your shell is configured properly.

## Examples

### Describing escape sequences

Just use `printf` to send some sequences to `sequin` for an explanation.

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;5;4mCiao, \x1b[1;7mBaby.\x1b[0m\n" | sequin
```

### Reading the output of a program

You can also use it to check the output of any program, for instance, `ls` or `git`.

```bash
ls -1 --color=always | sequin
```

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75166b2b-7cf5-4d78-97b2-901d00474591" width="400"></p>

```bash
git -c status.color=always status -sb | sequin
```

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd71c27-198b-4bad-9096-91bc1e944bad" width="450"></p>

So yeah, it‚Äôs great for debugging applications, and of course, learning about ANSI!

> [!NOTE]
> Many programs render their output as plain text when output isn't a terminal
> (i.e. when redirecting to a file or piping to a program, like `sequin`). This
> is a good thing, except in this case when we actually want ANSI sequences so
> we can inspect them. Thankfully there are usually ways to force colors, like

> specific program.

### Examining golden files

Golden file for TUIs contain ANSI, which can be easily inspected with `sequin`:

```console
$ cat ./testdata/MyCuteApp.golden | sequin
```

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16367a79-0ee3-40e1-95ae-adc46f411192" width="580"></p>

To generate golden files for your TUIs have a look at [`golden`][golden] and [`teatest`][teatest] from the [`/x`][x] project.

## Pro Mode: Syntax Highlighting for Raw Sequences

One of the pain points that we find when reading raw ANSI output is
that it‚Äôs hard to visually separate sequences from reguar text. For situations
like this you can use the `--raw`/`-r` flag to simply highlight sequences inline:

```bash
git -c status.color=always status -sb | sequin -r && echo
```

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b19a81-934e-4b87-b86d-2aa2a25b8c5d" width="450"></p>

## How it all works

Sequin relies heavily on our glorious [`ansi`][ansi] package, currently in the
elusive [`/x`][x] project. Whilst traversing the strings, Sequin pretty prints
what the sequences are and what they‚Äôre doing.

[ansi]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/x/ansi
[bubbletea]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
[golden]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/golden
[teatest]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/x/tree/main/exp/teatest
[x]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/x

## Is it done?

No! Common sequences are implemented, but there is still plenty of work to
do. For instance, APC sequences are not supported yet. If you notice one 
of such missing sequences, or want to work on any other area of the project, 
feel free to open a PR. üíò
