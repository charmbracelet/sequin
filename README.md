Human-readable ANSI sequences.

```console
$ printf '\033[48;2;255;0;0m\033[m' | sequin
CSI "\x1b[48;2;255;0;0m": Background color: {255 0 0 255}
CSI "\x1b[m": Reset style
```

Sequin is a small utility that can help you debug your CLI or TUI applications.

The most basic use case is to describe what an escape sequence does when you
don't know it.

You can `printf '<sequences>' | sequin` and get an explanation!

More complex use cases might include checking [teatest][]'s golden files.

<details>
  <summary>Golden Files example</summary>

```console
$ cat ./testdata/TestApp.golden | sequin
CSI "\x1b[?25l": Disable private mode "cursor visibility"
CSI "\x1b[?2004h": Enable private mode "bracketed paste"
Control code "\r": carriage return
Text: "Hi. This program will exit in 10 seconds. To quit sooner press any key"
Control code "\n": line feed
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[A": Cursor up 1
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[2K": Erase entire line
Text: "Hi. This program will exit in 9 seconds. To quit sooner press any key."
Control code "\n": line feed
CSI "\x1b[70D": Cursor left 70
CSI "\x1b[2K": Erase entire line
Control code "\r": carriage return
CSI "\x1b[?2004l": Disable private mode "bracketed paste"
CSI "\x1b[?25h": Enable private mode "cursor visibility"
CSI "\x1b[?1002l": Disable private mode "mouse cell motion"
CSI "\x1b[?1003l": Disable private mode "mouse all motion"
CSI "\x1b[?1006l": Disable private mode "mouse SGR ext"
```

You can also use it to check the output of any program[^pipe], for instance, `ls` and `glow`.

  <summary>Reading the output of other programs</summary>

```console
$ ls -1 --color=always | sequin
CSI "\x1b[38;5;4m": Foreground color: 4
CSI "\x1b[1m": Bold
Text: "folder"
CSI "\x1b[0m": Reset style
Control code "\n": line feed
Text: "file.txt"

$ glow -s dark README.md | sequin
Control code "\n": line feed
CSI "\x1b[;;1m": Bold
CSI "\x1b[0m": Reset style
CSI "\x1b[;;1m": Bold
CSI "\x1b[0m": Reset style
Text: "  "
CSI "\x1b[;;1m": Bold
Text: " "
CSI "\x1b[0m": Reset style
CSI "\x1b[;;1m": Bold
Text: "sequin"

$ git -c status.color=always status -sb | sequin
Text: "## "
CSI "\x1b[32m": Foreground color: Green
Text: "main"
CSI "\x1b[m": Reset style
Text: "..."
CSI "\x1b[31m": Foreground color: Red
Text: "origin/main"
CSI "\x1b[m": Reset style
Control code "\n": line feed
```

So you may also use it to debug applications, and of course, to learn more!

## How it works

It relies heavily on our [ansi][] package, and whilst traversing the strings,
pretty prints what the sequences are doing.

Check [ansi][] out to learn more!

## Current state

Common sequences are implemented, but there is still plenty of work to do. For
instance, APC sequences are not supported yet.
If you notice one of such missing sequences, or want to work on any other area
of the project, feel free to open a PR. üòÑ

[^pipe]:
    Beware: some programs might render their output as plain text when it
    detects that the output isn't a terminal (e.g. when redirecting to a file,
    or to another program, like we are doing in the examples).
    Usually there are ways around this, like setting `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` or flags
    to force colorful output. You might need to check what works in your case!
